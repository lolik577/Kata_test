Now you’re gone
I realise my love for you was strong
And I miss you here now you’re gone
I keep waiting here by the phone
With your pictures hanging on the wall

Now you’re gone
I realise my love for you was strong
And i miss you here now you’re gone
I keep waiting here by the phone
With your pictures hanging on the wall

Is this the way it’s meant to be?
Only dreaming that you’re missing me
I’m waiting here at home
I’ll be crazy now you’re gone

There’s an empty place in my heart
It won’t alarm me it will break apart
It won’t heal, it never fades away
I’ll be thinkin’ ’bout you everyday

Are you Ready?
Ready for take-off!

Now you’re gone
I realise my love for you was strong
And i miss you here now you’re gone
I keep waiting here by the phone
With your pictures hanging on the wall
